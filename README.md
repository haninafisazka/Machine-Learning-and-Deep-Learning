# Machine-Learning-and-Deep-Learning

## Assignment Ch. 4 - Machine Learning and Deep Learning
Welcome to Chapter 4 of the Machine Learning and Deep Learning course in the Artificial Intelligence Track at Startup Campus. In this assignment, we will explore various aspects of machine learning, including clustering, supervised learning, and deep learning. The assignment is designed to help us build and evaluate models and understand neural networks.

## Assignment Outcomes (Target Portfolio)
By completing this assignment, we should be able to:
1. Perform data segmentation using clustering methods.
2. Design and compare multiple supervised learning models.
3. Design and build a simple neural network model for the MNIST Handwritten Digit Dataset.


## TASK 1 - Bank Customer Churn Prediction ##

This project focuses on predicting customer churn in the banking industry. Customer churn, also known as customer attrition, refers to the decision of customers to discontinue their use of the bank's services. Predicting churn can help banks take proactive measures to retain their customers and improve customer satisfaction.

### Project Overview
#### 1. Data Collection
The dataset is obtained from this source. It contains various features related to bank customers, such as age, balance, geographical location, and whether they are active members.

#### 2. Data Preprocessing
Initial data preprocessing includes removing irrelevant columns and one-hot encoding categorical features.

#### 3. Data Split
The dataset is split into training and testing sets with a 75-25 split ratio.

#### 4. Model Selection
This project explores the performance of different machine learning models to predict customer churn. The models considered are:
- CatBoost Classifier
- XGBoost Classifier
- LightGBM Classifier
#### 5. Model Training and Evaluation
Each model is trained using the training data and evaluated using various performance metrics such as accuracy. The goal is to determine the best-performing model.
